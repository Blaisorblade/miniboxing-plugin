newSource1.scala:11: warning: The side-effecting statement(s) in the miniboxed class C's constructor will not be miniboxed. Please note this is a transient limitation until bugs #64 and #105 in the miniboxing plugin are addressed (see https://github.com/miniboxing/miniboxing-plugin/issues/64 and https://github.com/miniboxing/miniboxing-plugin/issues/105 for more details). For a partial workaround, please see https://github.com/miniboxing/miniboxing-plugin/issues/64:
  t = t2

newSource1.scala:1: warning: Heads-up: Optimizing `MbArray` is only possible if you allow the plugin to use both long and double encodings (remove `P:minibox:Yone-way` compiler option). `MbArray`-s will be generic and will box.
