newSource1.scala:13: warning: Use MbArray instead of Array and benefit from miniboxing specialization. For more details about MbArrays, please check the following link: http://scala-miniboxing.org/arrays.html

newSource1.scala:34: warning: Although the type parameter S of method Test.zoo is specialized, miniboxing and specialization communicate among themselves by boxing (thus, inefficiently) on all classes other than as FunctionX and TupleX. If you want to maximize performance, consider switching from specialization to miniboxing: '@miniboxed T':
  zoo[Int](3)
