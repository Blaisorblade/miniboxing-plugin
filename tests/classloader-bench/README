If you want to redo the classloader benchmarks, run:

./prepare.sh
 - will compile scala.collection.immutable.Vector with specialization and with
miniboxing. You will get the size stats at the end.
 - will compile the miniboxing runtime and classloader and will move them into
the jars directory
 - will make a comparison between code sizes

./compile.sh
 - will compile the benchmarks

./run.sh
 - will execute the benchmarks (can take useful parameters)
